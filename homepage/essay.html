            By The Waterfront
          </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>Before East River Park was built, the waterfront was a safe harbor for many shipping interests. In the mid nineteenth century, as the sea trade shifted to deeper channels of the Hudson River, docks gave way to factories. In the late nineteenth century, it was submitted to the tenements. Before the Parks Commissioner Robert Moses developed his plan for a waterfront park, the East River waterfront was covered with slaughterhouses, glass factories, power stations, and railroad yards. He was aware that the attainment of land for a park in a compactly populated area was extremely expensive and fraught with upright difficulties, especially along the waterfront that was heavily industrialized. When East River Park was finally built, it has been slowly changing, receiving many renovations throughout the years. During the urban renewal project for the Lower East Side, an amphitheater was built in the park in 1941. It was used for concerts, graduation ceremonies, and plays. In 1973, the amphitheater was shut down due to budget cuts, and by 1980, it became unusable due to the attacks of Vandals. In 1949, a portion of the park was removed when the FDR Drive was widened. In 1963, South Street was expanded, projecting onto another section of the park.</p>
            <p>The first time I saw this place was when I was eight. My first thoughts on it were that it seemed like a peaceful place with a warm atmosphere. My parents had brought me and my siblings there to play until nightfall. Later on, we decided to explore the place a bit to get to know it more. We went to the right of East River Park and walked past fields with people chilling outside, under the bridge, and past Seal Park. After all the places we passed, we saw an amphitheater. The amphitheater had dried paint, there were plants growing on and around it, and the walls were chipped. Because we were alone in the area most of the time, we acted as if we owned the place. Every time we went to hang out there, we would almost always see people outside the area. When it was nightfall, fireflies would come out and start to flash bioluminescent light. We would catch them and put them in a jar. We would admire them up closely before releasing them back out. Before it got too dark, we would head home to clean ourselves before we head to bed.</p>
            <p>My New York is a place with hidden areas of peace, unlike the everyday chaos of the subway. East River Park has many differences compared to many places, like the subway. The subway has no nature underground while East River Park has a ton of trees and plants. The subway is used for transportation to get to certain places faster than on foot. East River Parkâ€™s purpose is for people to take their mind off of things and relax themselves and appreciate the nature around them. The subway is a very small space while East River Park is very spacious. Upon walking into the subway, one is inundated with sounds of metal screeching when a train arrives, lots of chatter, and music that people are producing. It also has some unpleasant smells such as garbage and smoke from cigarettes. In the East River Park, one can hear sounds of trees rustling from the wind, birds chirping, and waves crashing. The park also has smells like air and barbecues. The subway has sights full of people, dim lighting, and trains. East River Park has sights of the river, trees, flowers, and wildlife.</p>
